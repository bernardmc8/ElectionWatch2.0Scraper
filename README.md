# ElectionWatch2.0Scraper
## Simple web scraper I created for the Political Computer Science @ Berkeley Election Watch 2.0 App. 
The purpose of scraper.py is to scrape words and definitions from an online dictionary in order to create a database for the Political Word of the Day functionality on the app.
